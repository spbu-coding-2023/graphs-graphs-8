## Quick start
### Requirements
- Kotlin 1.9.23
- JDK 21
#### Start
Run it by
```
./gradlew run
```
### Saving graphs
You can save graphs graphs using SQLite and Neo4j
- When using Neo4j you have to enter uri, username and password to establish a connection.
- SQLite is a local database, you don't need to do anything, just select it in the application settings.

## Features
#### You can use basic algorithms
- Searching for clusters.
- Betweenness centrality.
- Graph force-directed drawing algorithm.
#### There are also other algorithms
- Find bridges.
- Find cycles.
- Find the shortest path using Ford-Bellman and Dijkstra algorithms.
- Find strongly connected components.
- Constructing a minimal spanning tree.
